## Goal
Your main goal in this assignment is to demonstrate the use of an ELK stack by achieving the following:
- Deploy an ELK stack in a Linux system
- A reasonable volume of Logs appear on Kibana (perhaps you can configure a test instance or a script that sends logs through to the ELK stack)

## Secondary goals (which shouldn’t distract you from your main goal)
- Preparing some dashboards in Kibana
- Setting up some filters in the “L” layer of the stack to blacklist or transform logs
- Replace Kibana with Graylog
